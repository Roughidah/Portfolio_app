        Hi there! I'm learning to build websites with Vue.js and this is my
        first project using Vue Router.

      Use the navigation above to explore different sections of my site. Each
      link will show you different content instantly!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is much faster than traditional websites because we're not loading
      new pages from the server each time.
