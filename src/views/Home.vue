        Hi there! I'm learning to build websites with Vue.js and this is my
        first project using Vue Router. Please check out the other pages because this home page is the most boring one.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Use the navigation above to explore different sections of my site. You can also toggle light and dark mode!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is much faster than traditional websites because we're not loading
      new pages from the server each time.
